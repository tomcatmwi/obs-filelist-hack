# obs-filelist-hack
1. Open a folder.
2. Put a bunch of images and videos into the folder.
3. Run `node generate.js` in that folder. You'll get a `filelist.txt` file.
4. Arrange the files in whatever order you need them for your presentation.
5. Run `node generate.js` again.
6. You'll get a `vlog.json` file which can be imported into OBS. No camera, microphone or anything else added, but hey, at least you don't have to painstakingly add every single file by hand!

Please submit your complaints, suggestions, comments to the nearest toilet. This is a fucking hack, don't expect it to be nice.
